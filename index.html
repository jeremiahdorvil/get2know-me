                <p>Youâ€™re disgusting. Lorem Ipsum is the single greatest threat. We are not - we are not keeping up with other websites. The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics! You know, it really doesnâ€™t matter what you write as long as youâ€™ve got a young, and beautiful, piece of text. Some people have an ability to write placeholder text... It's an art you're basically born with. You either have it or you don't.</p>

                <p>I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that wrote Lorem Ipsum, but I don't know, maybe it was. It could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be some wordsmith sitting on their bed that weights 400 pounds. Ok? An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that Lorem Ipsum's birth certificate is a fraud.</p>

                <p>Look at these words. Are they small words? And he referred to my words - if they're small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there's no problem, I guarantee. If Trump Ipsum werenâ€™t my own words, perhaps Iâ€™d be dating it. You could see there was text coming out of her eyes, text coming out of her wherever.</p>
